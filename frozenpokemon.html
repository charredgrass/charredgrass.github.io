<h2>Frozen Pokemon</h2>
<br>
<p>Frozen Pokemon is a (free) game made in RPG Maker XP using the Pokemon Essentials template. It uses Gen V mechanics, but I am working on special Mega Evolutions for the game.</p>

<p>FAQ</p>

<strong>Is this legal?</strong>
I am not making any money off this game. Yes, it's legal, just like <a href="http://www.pokemonzetaomicron.com/">Pokemon Zeta/Omicron</a> and several other fangames made in the same program.
<br>
<strong>When will you release this game?</strong>
I am planning to release a Beta version by June that will include the first part of the game, but I do not intend for the game to be FULLY complete for a while.
<br>
<strong>Will I be able to keep the save data from an incomplete beta copy of the game when upgrading to the full version?</strong>
Yes!
<br><strong>Is this a ROM hack?</strong>
No!
<br><strong>Where can I contact you?</strong>
PM me on Reddit at /u/charredgrass. I check that the most often.
<br><strong>What else are you working on?</strong>
<a href = "http://brokenpipesoftware.com/Maxwell/frozenclicker/frozenclicker0121.html">Frozen Clicker</a>, a Cookie Clicker-like game based on Frozen. Also, <a href="http://www.brokenpipesoftware.com/Maxwell/charredgrass/frozenbukkits">Frozen Bukkits</a>, a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft.
