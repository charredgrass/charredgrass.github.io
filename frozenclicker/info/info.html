	<h2>Info</h2>
	<p>I am /u/charredgrass! This is the source code for my game Frozen Clicker!
It's heavily inspired by the movie Frozen by Disney and the game Cookie Clicker by Ortiel.
Lots of the code was inspired by CivClicker by David Holley, I looked at it to learn some of the javascript I didn't know, but it this game is all original code.
This code is published under the MIT Creative Commons Liscence</p><p>
I am not sponsored by, or affiliated by in any way by Disney, Frozen, Cookie Clicker, Ortiel, Civ Clicker, nor David Holley.
